This cript does the following below:

The script will read the CSV file, create each user on the server, and add to an existing group called developers (You will need to manually create this group ahead).
Ensure that your script will first check for the existence of the user on the system, before it will attempt to create that it.
Ensure that the user that is being created also has a default home folder
Ensure that each user has a .ssh folder within its HOME folder. If it does not exist, then create it.
For each userâ€™s SSH configuration, create an authorized_keys file and add the below public key.
